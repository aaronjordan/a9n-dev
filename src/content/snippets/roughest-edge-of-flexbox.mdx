title: The roughest edge of flexbox?

import CodeGroup from "../../components/CodeGroup.astro";

Like every other sane developer who's worked on the web in the last ten years, I **love** flexbox. It's so much more convenient to work with and easy to reason about than [twelve columns](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#grid-example-basic) or anything else I've run into with blocks. A quick `display: flex` (or, with Tailwind, just `flex`) unlocks so many superpowers... These are the first to come to mind:

- splitting elements as far apart as possible within a container
- centering a `<div>` both horizontally and vertically
- creating dynamic and interesting tiling without having to do any math

// ^ could these be details elements with expandable demos?

Of course, we can even flip the container around, running the main axis of the flexbox vertically rather than horizontally across the page. It's [super common](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/card) and works beautifully for stacking content with consistent spacing that doesn't require any special handling for the first or last element as it would otherwise. _That said,_ there can be a subtle catch to that transposition.

## How is this column so big!

In this example, there's a toggle to disable text wrapping in the inner boxes. The container is a simple grid layout with named areas and the elements in each have a `max-width` of 100%, so they are permitted to fill all of the _available_ horizontal space. Add some text to the code block and note the effect on the elements in the flex container.

<CodeGroup files={["first.css", "second.js"]}>
<Fragment slot="0">

```css
.my-class {
  display: grid;
  width: 75%;
  margin: auto;
}
```

</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="1">

```js
import * as React from "react";

function hello() {
  // greet the user
  console.log("hello world");
}

hello();
```

</Fragment>
</CodeGroup>

_Did you expect that?_

We shouldn't be able to use more than the available space given the `max-width` set — how on earth is this filling beyond our layout!? It turns out that this is how grid resolves oversize `display: flex` content in the absence of an explicit `overflow` behavior. In contrast, if the outer layout was a `block`, the text exceeding the block's size would be hidden by default, which might be more intuitive.

One decent, straightforward solve for this is to make the overflowing container scrollable. We can do in a couple quick steps:

1. Let's set `overflow-x: hidden` on the `flex-col` to stop the container from expanding to fit the intrinsic width of the long `<pre>` element.
2. Apply `overflow-x: auto` to the `<pre>` element to enable horizontal scrolling within.

Alternately, we could even just set `overflow-x: auto` on the column and this setting will affect the immediate children of the flexbox. If you aren't dealing with scrolling in nested layouts, this may be a pretty neat workaround.

All in all, I thought this was a weird edge case. I hadn't seen this too often, but now have hit this CSS quirk twice in the past month, so figured it was worth sharing!

Thanks for reading. 🔥
