title: Stop writing Cursor rules
subtitle: or CLAUDE.md or 800 individual markdown files of AI slop
---

In my opinion, this is one of the most annoying things about AI-assisted development. Mainstream agents by default _(in my experience)_ will excitedly create dozens of files to document anything they do, regardless of the usefulness of expanded docs. I've seen and deleted 200-line `HOW_TO_USE_THIS_COMPONENT.md` files that cover every obvious edge case of a 20-line function. They _overflow_ with emoji, "BAD:", and "GOOD:". Surely, we can do better than this.

## Try to be concise

Take the same 20-line function and throw it at any LLM powering these agents and it will almost definitely catch everything documented in the markdown. Got a _weird_ edge case? Write a _code_ comment. This gives the LLM **(or the human!)** context without sinking into any proprietary format.

```ts
/**
 * Subscribes to realtime data updates.
 *
 * The root layout needs to enable this subscription by providing an
 * access token through the `enableRealtimeData` RPC first, which will
 * set a cookie required for this hook.
 */
export function useRealtimeData() { ... }
```

## Try to be open

Need to direct the model toward a project-level standard? Let _everyone_ benefit from your custom rules by using [the open standard, `AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md).

I used one of these for the first time earlier this week and _gasped_ seeing just how easily Claude 4.5 Sonnet took the suggestion within. After a struggle to get Cursor rules to work effectively for my team, disappointment knowing other agents wouldn't pick up on those well, and uncomfortably watching a global `/docs` directory grow with loads of task specific content, this format is a breath of fresh air.

It's directory-specific: you can have a ton of them littered throughout a project, particularly great for a monorepo. It's easy to work with _as a human_ as there's no folder structures or proprietary configuration flags to memorize. It cascades when working with an agent, so your preferred AI assistant will grab all the relevant `AGENTS.md` files back up to the project root. It works out of the box in Cursor, Claude Code, Devin — you name it. It's a single line of configuration for the Gemini CLI.

All you _need_ to do is write a little bit of thoughtful markdown.
