I build software that delights users and empowers developers.

Throughout my career, I've been on big teams at small companies, tiny teams at
huge companies, and everything in between. I've built a reputation for seeing
how to extract the most from frameworks, regularly crafting tooling to simplify
development tasks, and being a little obsessed with everything going on under
the hood.

## Now

I live in Portland, Oregon with my wife Mazlin and our dog Trout. In addition
to them, my ND Mazda Miata is a source of fun and entertainment. I follow
Formula One, love getting out into nature, and play a little guitar from time
to time.

At Woflow, I'm helping to bring structure to unstructured data for some very
large clients. Returning to React and TypeScript development after a couple of
years at Google has been a delight. I've never felt more connected to the
modern web ecosystem as I do now. It's an exciting time to be building
software.
