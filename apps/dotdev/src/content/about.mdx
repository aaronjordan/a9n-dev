I write software that users and developers love.

Throughout my career, I've been on big teams at small companies, tiny teams at
huge companies, and everything inbetween. Over and again, I've seen my
reputation emerge as the one who sees how to extract the most from our
frameworks, regularly crafts tooling to simpilfy development tasks, and is a
little obsessed with everything going on under the hood. Given everything, I'm
convinced that there has never been a better time to write software.

## Now

I live in Portland, Oregon with my wife Mazlin and our dog Trout. In addition
to them, my ND Mazda Miata is a source of fun and entertainment. I follow
Formula One, love getting out into nature, and play a little guitar from time
to time.

As noted above, I'm at Woflow helping to bring structure to unstructured data
for some very large clients. It's been a delight to return to React and
TypeScript development after a couple of years at Google working with a similar
framework that's dead outside their repositories. I've never felt more connected
to the moment on the modern web as I do now. It's a joy to follow!
